Hello, my name is Anish Sundaram and I am a 2nd year studying CS. I am mainly interested in
 Data Science and Web Development so I hope to become an active face around here! I have
some prior experience with DS but I hope to be able to learn a lot and contribute to projects. 
A fun fact about me is that I am a big fan of language learnign and can speak 4 languages to varying degrees currently, and I hope to add another to the list!
